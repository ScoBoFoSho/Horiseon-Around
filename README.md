# Horiseon-Around
### A Challenge 1 webpage for Miami Boot Camp; this web page demonstrates a basic website layout with the advantage of HTML5 semantic elements [to replace divs], consolidated CSS styling to match the Acceptance Criteria, and clear comments to describe the relative effefcts of HTML and CSS IDs, elements, and classes. 

### The content of this page (as determined through the starter code) explores website navigation, consolidation, and organiization for the benefit of screen readers and search results. By refactoring the code, the website functions on a sound level allowing users with disabilites to properly use screen readers and to aid search engines in better identifying sections (and impotrance of sections) on the page.
